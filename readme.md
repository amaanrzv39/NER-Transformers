# Project Description
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying entities such as names, organizations, locations, dates, and more within text. In this project, Transformer-based models, specifically Amaan39/btc-ner, are utilized to perform high-accuracy NER.

Several Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transformers library, are used. The input text dataset is preprocessed to make it suitable for training a transformer model. A small transformer model is developed and trained on the preprocessed dataset. Finally, distilbert-base-cased model is selected from the Hugging Face Hub and fine-tuned for named entity recognition.

A FastAPI-based REST API is implemented to extract named entities from the given input text using the Hugging Face pipeline for NER.
